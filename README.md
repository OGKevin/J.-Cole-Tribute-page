* ~~Transitions aren't smooth.~~ Way better due to JSON but still not animated.
* Embanded datpiff player doesn't load due HTTP over HTTPS.
* Grey boxes are to big.
* ~~Used wrong technique to hide the elements at page first load.~~
* Looks rubbish on smaller screens.
* Side bar changes size when the "#info" div gets bigger or smaller.
* "#info" div is to far to the right due invisible territory of the sidebar.
